/* Higher oder function*/ 

=> aisa func jo accept krle ek aur fnc ya fir wo return krde ek aur func. eg forEach
=> In this definition, operations can mean taking one or more functions as an argument
    OR returning a function as the result. It doesn't have to do both. Doing one or the 
    other qualifies a function as a higher order function.
    eg. forEach(), map()
    const arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
    const arr2 = arr1.map(item => item * 2);
    console.log(arr2);

/* Constructor function*/

=> what?
   normal func jisme "this" ka istemaal ho and aap func ko call krte waqt "new" keyword 
   ka use kre.
=> A func which whenever invoked with "new keyword" returns an object, if we use "this"
   keyword inside that function, it returns an obj with all of the properties and methods 
   mentioned inside that function. 
=> why use?
   jab aapke paas aisa koi bhi mauka ho ke aapko ek jaisi properties wale bahut saare
   elements banane hai us waqt hum constructor function use krenge.
   eg.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h2>JavaScript Object Constructors</h2>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>

// Constructor function for Person objects
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
  this.firstName = first;
  this.lastName = last;
  this.age = age;
  this.eyeColor = eye;
}

// Create two Person objects
const myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
const myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

// Display age
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My father is " + myFather.age + ". My mother is " + myMother.age + "."; 

</script>

</body>
</html>

To prove functions are objects in JavaScript
// We can add properties to functions like we do with objects
myFather.age = '80';

  ********************************************************************************

  /* First class function */

  A language is said to have First class functions when the functions in that language are  treated as normal
  values or like variables, you can save them, you can pass them as arguments to another functions.
  eg. pass - setTimeOut(),map()


   ********************************************************************************

   /* new keyword */

   The new keyword is used in JavaScript to create a object from a constructor function. The new keyword
   has to be placed before the constructor function call and will do the following things: Creates a new object.

   /* IIFE */

   An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. 
   (function () {
    // …
   })();
   //  the second parenthesis is responsible to tell the compiler that the function expression has to be executed 
       immediately.

       The Function Expression allows us to create an anonymous function that doesn’t have any function name which
       is the main difference between Function Expression and Function Declaration. A function expression can be 
       used as an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)which runs as soon as it is defined. 

       Function Expressions: It is simple to understand that a Function Expression is a Function that is used as an 
       expression. JavaScript lets us use Functions as Function Expressions if we Assign the Function to a variable,
       wrap the Function within parentheses or put a logical not in front of a function. The following program 
       illustrates the different ways we can create a Function Expression. 

       // Creating Function Expression by assigning to a variable. 
        var myFunc = function() { return "GeeksforGeeks"; }; 

        // Creating Function Expression Using Logical Not. 
        !function() { return "GeeksforGeeks"; }; 

        // Creating Function Expression Using Parentheses. 
        (function() { return "GeeksforGeeks"; });

   why need?
   1. We would also use IIFE to create private and public variables and methods. 
   2. Avoid polluting the global namespace
      Because our application could include many functions and global variables from different source files, it's 
      important to limit the number of global variables. If we have some initiation code that we don't need to use 
      again, we could use the IIFE pattern. As we will not reuse the code again, using IIFE in this case is better 
      than using a function declaration or a function expression.

  Notes:
  1.IIFEs have their own scope i.e. the variables you declare in the Function Expression will not be available outside 
  the function.
  2.Similarly to other functions IIFEs can also be named or anonymous, but even if an IIFE does have a name it is 
  impossible to refer/invoke it.
  3.IIFEs can also have parameters. For example, 
  <script> 
	// Declaring the parameter required. 
	(function(dt) { 
		console.log(dt.toLocaleTimeString()); 
		// Passing the Parameter. 
	})(new Date()); 
</script>

use cases:
Avoid polluting the global namespace 
To create closures
Avoid conflict of variable names between libraries and programs.
IIFE is used to create private and  public variables and methods
It is used to execute the async and await function
It is used in JQuery Library
It is used to work with require function

var ans =(function(){
  var privateVal = 23; //private

  return{
   getter: function(){
      console.log(privateVal);
   },
   setter: function(val){
      priavteVal = val;
   }
  }
})()

/* Prototype */

js by default adds a property called [[prototype]]. It contains many helper properties
and methods we can use to complete our tasks.
(many prop and methods are already avaialble to use by js creators inside prototype 
 of every OBJECT) eg. .length()
